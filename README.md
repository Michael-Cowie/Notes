# General Notes

As a Software Engineer, I’ve realized the vastness of knowledge in the field. To aid my understanding, I’ve developed a habit of handwriting notes, which I’ve found to enhance my comprehension and retention. Over time, I’ve compiled several books of these notes, covering a broad spectrum of topics.

Despite my initial organization, some notes have become slightly scattered and inaccessible when I’m away from home. To address this, I’ve created a repository to digitally store my notes, ensuring their preservation and easy retrieval.

This repository serves as a quick reference point to refresh my knowledge. The notes, often restructured for clarity, are derived from various resources, reflecting my personal approach to understanding complex concepts.

## Structure

For note-taking, I primarily use markdown files. Diagrams are created using the [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/), markdown extension, supported by GitHub.

For mathematical equations, I employ MathJax with GitHub flavored markdown. However, due to limitations with inline vectors, I write these files using LaTeX and store them on Overleaf. To display them on GitHub, I export them to PDF format and upload them manually.

Automatic regeneration of PDF files for associated LaTeX files was not feasible due to the potential for an infinite loop with GitHub actions. While I use Overleaf to edit my LaTeX files and sync them to my GitHub account, the PDF files need to be manually downloaded and uploaded.
