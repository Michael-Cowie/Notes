# File Types

When programming in Python, we will common across multiple file types. Some common file types are `.py`, `.pyc` and `.pyd`, other more uncommon file types could be `.pyi` and `.pyw`. Here is where I will define
the common file types that we will be exposed to be most,

## .py

## .pyc

## .pyd

## .pyo

## Wheels

Python wheels will typically contain the extension `.egg` and `.whl`. This is explanined further inside of [my existing notes for them](https://github.com/Michael-Cowie/Notes/blob/main/Python/Notes/PyPI_PIP_Wheel.md).
