    <h1> Holding the Paddle - Backhand </h1>
</div>

When holding the paddle for a backhand, the position of the index finger at the back remains the same. **The key difference is the thumb**. Now, we raise the thumb slightly higher in order to support the paddle to give it more power.

    <h1> Stance </h1>
</div>

For the backhand loop the right foot should be slightly infront of the left foot this, allow for **rotation of the body to generate power**. This stance is true for both topspin and backspin, both will use rotation of the body when performing the backhand loop. In addition to this the feet should be **slightly than shoulder width apart**.

Their will be a difference between the body stance in terms of how deep you kneel versus backspin and topspin which will be addressed below.

- **Very Close** - For a very close ball, you use the **banana flick**.

</div>

- **Mid Range** - For a mid range backhand loop, it's very important for 80% to 90% of the underarm and the wrist. You don't want to use the hip and shoulder for a midrange shot. In addition, notice that the **elbow is high**.

- **Long Range** - This is the type of looped where we need to more far more of the hip for power.

    <h1> Backhand Motion and Versus Topspin </h1>
</div>

Using your waist is essential for the backhand loop. The movement **should be side to side**.

1. Slightly tuck in the abdomen.
2. Start your hand **slightly left of the stomach**, not in the center. From the center you cannot generate power. As the movement is restricted from down to upwards when performing the loop, this is very weak.
3. Pivot on your right leg while internally rotating wrist/forearm.
4. Start with the upper arm leading the forearm. Then the upper arm leading the wrist. Finally, the paddle tip comes through. This is a complete power sequence and it must be a complete chain movement.
5. Even if you're perfectly aware that the backhand technique will be used, it's still important to not preemptively prepare yourself. This means you should not pull your paddle down and "hold it". It should not be a two motion movement, but one. Instead, wait and perform the backhand loop in one swift movement with acceleration included.
6. Versus **topspin**, tighten the core first then **brush forward with power**. Wrist rotation is much smaller versus topspin, the stroke is compact and explosive. Wrist rotation is used for more backspin.

The correct feeling of the backhand loop is the following.

- Your racket meets the balls surface with a brushing contact. You cannot muscle through it, grip the balls surface and spin it outward through the whipping motion. This sensation defines true looping. Hitting into it directly is not proper looping technique.
- **Do not brush upward, brush forward**.
- At the same time, your forearm/wrist/wait supply controlled power into that brushing path.
- Think of it as "brushing through the ball with power". This is not two steps, but one blended contact.

**Against topspin**, imagine you are "brushing forward through" the ball with a bit more drive.

Small but critical details which make a great forehand loop are,

1. **Elbow Placement** - Swing it freely.

<div align='center'>
    <img src='images/zhang_jike_backhand_form_5.gif'>
</div>

2. **Follow Through** - Similar to the forehand, it's crucial to follow through. The backhand loop requires the waist and legs to generate power, not just the arms. Additionally, **do not deliberately go upward**. Brush and go forward. When you go rotate, go forward.

</div>

2. **Correct Paddle Contact** - When looping with the backhand, the contact point on the rubber should be **slightly above center**. This helps to create a whipping effect. If you contact the ball too low on the rubber, that is incorrect as you will not get enough brushing action either.

</div>

3. **Correct Ball Contact** - Hit the **upper middle part of the ball**. A brushing contact is essential, but so is the point of contact. Without doing so, the angle racket will be incorrect.

<div align='center'>

</div>

5. **Wrist Adjustment After Contact** - A constant racket angle is incorrect. While versus topspin it is a much less of an angle versus backspin, a constant angle is not correct. When performing a loop you **must push forward**. This means to **hold the ball, then push forward**. This happens from a combination of brushing (To grab the ball) then push forward to produce power. The paddle angle **should change from closed open to closed, do not keep the same paddle angle**. "Press down" doesn't mean literally pushing the ball downard into the table. It refers to a **controlled closing of a racket angle and slightly brushing over the ball** to keep it low and stable. The "press down" happens **right at and immediately after contact**.

7. **Foot Stance** - The left foot is usually a **tiny bit** behind the right foot.

8. **Wrist movement** - Rotate the wrist outwards on completion.

    <h1> Versus Backspin </h1>
</div>

**Do not brush upward, brush forward**. When you lower your center of gravity and tuck your wrist inward, the forward motion naturally has an upward motion. When lowering your center of gravity, the forward strike naturally generates an upward force.
