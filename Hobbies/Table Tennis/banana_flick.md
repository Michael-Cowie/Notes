    <h1> Backhand Banana Flick </h1>
</div>

The banana flick is a backhand flick with side and topspin, curving the ball over the net. Itâ€™s especially effective against short serves to the backhand and is a favorite in modern play. Use the banana flick when,

1. The ball **is short** and bouncing close to the net.
2. The ball is on your backhand side.
3. There is **backspin or no spin** on the serve.
4. You want to **attack a short ball with spin and placement**.

The first thing to do when performing the banana flick is to,

1. Move your body to the ball and step in with your dominant foot.
2. Lean forward and create enough space for a powerful arm movement.
3. Stand a bit sideways.
4. Get low and bring your wrist close to the surface of the table.
