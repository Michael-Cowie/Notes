</div>

Good footwork is vital to get into position and move effiently. Without proper footwork you will miss the opportunity to get in propert position to get a good hit.

The way most players like Ma Long perform footwork is to perform jumping actions to ensure to get into correct position quickly. The key characteristics are,

1. Have a strong core the entire game. Similar to how you would perform the planking exercise.
2. Feet wide apart and weight on the balls of your feet.
3. Knees bent
4. Springs with both feet
5. Feet remain apart during the jump
6. Your weight distribution should be slightly forward, around 60-70% on the balls of your feet, **not the heels**. Heels touch the ground **lightly** for balance, but your center of gravity should be forward and low.

**Avoid doing too many steps**, more steps is a loss of power. If required to move large distances, perform large single steps.
