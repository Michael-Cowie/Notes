    <h1> Forehand Flick </h1>

#### Stance

The flick is an agressive return used against **short balls**, usually serves or short pushes. It involves quickly lifting the ball over the net with a snap of the wrist, generating speed and light topspin. Whilst the push shot uses an open racket, the forehand flick **uses a closed racket**. If your opponent plays a return short over the net, there is often opportunity to play a forehand flick stroke. Because we're using a closed racket, we're often relying on the backspin on the ball to get it over the net. Often good technique involves keep the racket in a slight open position when getting into the correct stance and then used a close paddle. It should be used,

1. Against **short serves** or or short pushes **that are not heavily backspun**.
2. When you want to gain initiative instead of pushing.
3. To surprise opponents who expect a passive return.

When performing the forehand flick the first thing to get right is the position of your body. This technique is performed primarily on short serves and therefore requires the receiver to get close to the table with their dominant foot under the table. This is done to later extend your body and reach the ball. It's also necessary to bend in your knee.

#### Timing

The timing is the next important concept, when performing the forehand flick **we need to wait for the apex of the flight**. Waiting until the ball is at its highest point, gives the best opportunity to perform the forehand flick. If you attempt to hit the ball too late when the balls position is closer to the table, the execution cannot be that effective.

#### Racket Angle

The racket angle is **always dependent on the incoming spin**. If the incoming ball has much more backspin, you need to slightly open your paddle more. In addition to this your stroke will also be more upwards. Initially the paddle is in an open position, but will later be transferred to a close position. **Remember to compensate for sidespin when performing the flick** by remembering the direction to slightly tilt the paddle.

You must not use your upper arm otherwise you will lose control. Focus on your forearm, wrist and fingers. Finally, a sudden acceleration to hit the ball.
