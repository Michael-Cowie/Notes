    <h1> Design Pattern Introduction </h1>

Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code. Patterns are typical solutions to common problems in object-oriented design.

**You can't just find a pattern and copy it** into your program, the way you can with off-the-shelf functions or libraries. The pattern is not a specific piece of code, **but a general concept for solving a particular problem**. You can follow the pattern details and implement a solution that suits the realities of your own program.

Patterns are often confused with algorithms, because both concepts describe typical solutions to some known problems. While an algorithm always defines a clear set of actions that can achieve a goal, a pattern is a more **high-level description of a solution**. The code of the same pattern applied to two different programs may be different.

Design patterns are a toolkit of tried and tested solutions to common problems in software design. Even if you never encounter these problems, knowing patterns is still useful because it teaches you how to solve all sorts of problems using principles of object-oriented design.

Do not create unjustified usages of patterns. The saying `If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail`. This is a problem that haunts many novices, who have just familiarized themselves with patterns. Having learn about patterns, they try to apply them everywhere, even in situations where simpler code would do just fine.

Design patterns differ by their complexity, level of detail and scale of applicability to the entire system being designed. Similar to road construction. You can make an intersection safer by either installing some traffic lights or building an entire multi-level interchange with underground passages for pedestrians.

The most basic and low-level patterns are often called idioms. They usually apply only to a single programming language. The most universal and high-level patterns are architectural patterns. Developers can implement these patterns in virtually any language. Unlike other patterns, they can be used to design the architecture of an entire application.

All paterrns can be categorized by their intent or purpose. This directory covers [three main groups of patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/classification).

- **Creational Patterns** - Provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

- **Structural Patterns** - Explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

- **Behavioural Patterns** - Take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
